## What is SWGEmu? ##

[Star Wars Galaxies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars_Galaxies) was a massively multi-player online role playing game introduced by Sony Online Entertainment in the year 2003 and shut down in 2011.

The SWGEmu project is focused on recreating the SWG Experience as it was in "Pre-CU" or "Pre-Combat Upgrade". The CU radically changed the game-play and lead to the founding of this project as an attempt to recreate the game experience as it was in the Pre-CU era.
